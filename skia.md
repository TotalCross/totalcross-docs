# Skia

## Overview

Skia is an open source 2D graphics library that provides common APIs that work across a variety of hardware and software platforms. It serves as a graphical engine for Google Chrome and Chrome OS, Android, Mozilla Firefox and Firefox OS and many other products.

Skia is sponsored and managed by Google, but is available for use by anyone under the BSD Free Software License. Although major component engineering is done by the Skia development team, we consider the contributions from any source.

### Why did we choose skia?

TotalCross uses [OpenGL ](https://totalcross.gitbook.io/playbook/opengl)in the graphics, but this technology was depreciated in iOS and, to keep up with the constant upgrades and improvements that TotalCross proposes to do on all platforms, we decided that this was the best time to bring a complementary technology \(and even better\) to our tool. That's why Skia was chosen to be implemented.

### Impact of Skia on TotalCross

Among the many improvements that the implementation of skia has brought to TotalCross are: 

* General visual quality;
* Smoothing; 
* Fonts;
* Possibility of using fonts direct from `.ttf` \(extension commonly used to make fonts available for free on the internet\); 
* Velocity; 
* Memory Usage Optimization; 
* Easier to improve visual effects in TotalCross internally.
