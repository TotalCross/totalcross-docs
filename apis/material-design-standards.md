# Material Design Standards

We'll be passing through changes to the base Material Design looks. All of the changes will be listed below.

* [x] Buttons

  * Completely renovated design.
  * Left, right, top, bottom and icon paddings will be added, having their preferred values in Material standards, but also made possible to change by just changing the Button fields: paddingLeft, paddingRight, paddingTop, paddingBottom, and iconPadding.
  * The button will be which one you want from Material Design much more easily, like "Contained Button", "Contained Button with icon", "Outlined Button" and "Text Button".

  **Remember:** You'll always be able to modify all of these values the way you desire.

*  Check
  * Insets and text gap will be added, having their preferred values in Material standards.

    **Remember:** You'll always be able to modify all of these values the way you desire.
*  ComboBox
  * Completely renovated design.
  * Left, right, top and bottom paddings and icon gap will be added, having their preferred values in Material standards, but it is also possible to change them via public attributes.
  * The arrow color, margin, and size will change.
  * The ListBox used to show the options of the ComboBox component will also follow the Material standards.

    **Remember:** You'll always be able to modify all of these values the way you desire.
* \[X\] ListBox
  * Some design adjustments.
  * Left, right, top and bottom paddings will be added, having their preferred values in Material standards.
  * You'll be able to add a right icon now, having a left and right icon at the same time, if you want to. \(Previously, you only could add a left icon\)
  * You'll be able to control the gap between the icon and the item text.
  * The ListBox used on a DropDown context \(like on a ComboBox\) will follow its Material standards, which is different when it's used as a simple list.

    **Remember:** You'll always be able to modify all of these values the way you desire.
* [x] Edit

  * **OutlinedEdit** added, having the preferred values in Material standards, but made possible to change via public atributes and methods.
